        <p><strong>About me:</strong></p>
        <p>My name's Viviana and I'm from Irapuato which is a small town in Guanajuato in Mexico. Irapuato is <strong>famous</strong> for exporting strawberries across Mexico.</p>
        <p>I have a senior Dog, his name is Mateo and he is a Cocker Spaniel. He is currently in Mexico, we couldn't bring him with us because of the cold in the cargo area. I miss him every day but we will try to fly him with us as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>I really like listening to music and one of my favorite singers is Taylor Swift. I think she's a one talented songwriter, she has a song for <em>everything</em>. There is a quote that I'm really into it lately.</p>
        <p><blockquote>Take the moment and taste it, You've got no reason to be afraid<br>You're on your own, kid, you always have been &mdash;<cite><abbr title="You're on your own, Kid">YOYOK</abbr>, Taylor Swift</cite></blockquote></p>
        <p>Since moving to Canada, I say that to myself everytime I feel insecure of the change.</p>
        <p>Moving on to happier thoughts, my favorite colors are pink and yellow, I like watching movies and I really like pop culture.</p>
