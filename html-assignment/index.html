        <p>My name's Viviana and I'm from Irapuato which is a small town in Guanajuato in Mexico. Irapuato is <strong>famous</strong> for exporting strawberries throughout Mexico. I moved to Queretaro when I was 13 years old; Queretaro is a state close to my hometown, about 2 hours by car.</p>
        <p>I have a senior Dog, his name is Mateo and he is a Cocker Spaniel. He is currently in Mexico, we couldn't bring him with us because of the cold in the cargo area. I miss him every day but we will try to fly him with us as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>I really like listening to music and one of my favorite singers is Taylor Swift. I think she's a one talented songwriter, she has a song for <em>everything</em>. There is a quote that I'm really into it lately.</p>
